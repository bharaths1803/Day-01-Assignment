1)HHTP1 vs HTTP2
∙ Http1 is a very old version of http while http2 is an advanced version
∙ Http1 transfers all requests and respones in textual format whereas HTTP2 converts these into binary format
∙ Http1 uses head of line blocking meaning it blocks all requests behind it until all resources are 
acquired where as HTTP2 uses multiplexing allowing a single TCP connection for multiple requests
∙ Header information is repeated everytime in HTTP1 while HTTP2 uses HPACK to compress the header
∙ HTTP2 uses push frame to send CSS and JS files from the server while HTTP1 uses request resource inlining only

2)Objects and their internal representation in Javascript
∙ Objects in javascript are a reference data type which is in the form of key-value pairs
∙ The variables and the functions attached to an object are called properties and methods respectively
∙ An object can be created in several ways using let, new, Object.create method, and a constructor
∙ Here's an example of an object representing the rectangle shape created using different
ways

∙let rect = [length:10, breadth: 20,  area:30];
∙var rect = new Object();
 rect.length = 10;
 rect.breadth = 20;
 rect.area = 200;
∙function Rectangle(length, breadth, area){
       this.length = 10;
       this.breadth = 20;
       this.area = 200;
}
∙var Rectangle = {
  length : 10,
  breadth : 20,
  area : 200
  findPerimeter : function(){
    console.log(( 2 * (length + breadth));
  }
};
var rect = Object.create(Rectangle);

∙Accessing objects is done with the . operator. Here's one such example
 rect.findPerimeter();
 rect.length = 30;
